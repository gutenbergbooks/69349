<p>Her mother was a slack-wire performer in the
circus, and Patty was born in that part of the
dressing-room reserved for the feminine talent,
the privacy of which was a pleasant piece of fiction
due to the strip of canvas that “Old Props”
stretched across the tent in the centre. Immediately
behind the “wall” the male performers
struggled into pink tights, smoked cigarettes and
streaked the air with loud-mouthed oaths, regardless
of the proximity of the ladies, whose own
language, to tell the truth, was none too choice.</p>

<p>Patty came into the world somewhat unexpectedly.
Her parent, the only one she ever knew,
had been seized with a sudden dizziness right in
the middle of her great balancing act and had
fallen heavily in the ring, from which she was tenderly
carried to the ladies’ dressing-room, where,
two hours later, on a hastily improvised bed of
elephant trappings, camel coverings and spangled
suits, snatched from the property wardrobe, a little
mite of humanity was ushered into the world
amid the roaring of the lions, the hoarse bleat of
the hippopotamus, and the savage trumpetings of
the elephants in the menagerie adjoining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[3]</span></p>

<p>From her birth Patty was a great favorite with
Old Props, who, in the absence of a legitimate
father, constituted himself the male protector of
the petite girl baby, whose tiny fingers toyed carelessly
with the grizzled, brick-dusty beard of the
gruff circus man whenever he took her in his arms.
For Patty was raised with the circus. When she
was two weeks old her mother resumed her “act”
on the slack wire and from that time until her
death, which occurred when Patty was ten years
old, the little girl lived almost continuously in the
atmosphere of the sawdust ring.</p>

</div>

<p>Patty was a veritable daughter of the arena. At
a very tender age she had been taught to balance
herself on the back of a horse, and when her
mother died her education in bareback riding had
so far progressed that she was billed as an infant
prodigy, and was the source of endless entertainment
to the youngsters of every town visited by
the circus. Old Props was her guardian, a duty
that he had willingly assumed when Patty’s
mother died, leaving her daughter to his care. It
must be confessed that Patty’s education in the
polite arts was sadly neglected. Her grammar
was atrocious, and her knowledge of things in
general, not germane to the circus, was deplorably
slim. But her professional studies were pursued
with so much earnestness and avidity that<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
before she was in her teens her daring riding produced
a genuine sensation, and the advent of
“Mdle. Patti,” as she was known to the public,
was always the signal for a burst of applause, to
which the young equestrienne responded with one
of her most bewitching smiles.</p>

<p>Although fully up to the latest slang phrases,
Patty was by no means vicious, and only reflected
what she had imbibed, since as a tiny toddler of
three she had been lifted on the trick pony’s back
by careful Old Props and jogged around the track,
her merry eyes ablaze with delight, her baby voice
echoing the Hi! Ya! Hi! Ya! of the property boys
who clustered around the ring. In spite of her
surroundings Patty’s mind was remarkably pure.
The coarse jokes of the men and the covert allusions
of the women seemed to leave no taint in
their wake, while her naive expressions were a
constant delight to Old Props, who secretly exulted
in the innocence of his protegee and jealously
guarded her from the insidious advances of those
in whom the baser passions were uppermost.</p>

<p>Patty was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>. Of the world beyond the
circus she was totally ignorant. If she had a passion
it was for gay dresses and stunning jewelry,
while the “bravas,” elicited from an admiring
audience, was the sweetest music that her ears
ever knew. At the age of seventeen she was a<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
strikingly beautiful girl, overflowing with animal
spirits and enjoying perfect health, a robust young
goddess to whom all the other sawdust subjects
paid homage. Hers was a beauty that lacked
soul, however. Patty, poor girl, had never known
the refining influences of a home and the effect of
her environment was potent to the close observer.
Love was something foreign to her nature; that is
the love born of a tender passion. For Old Props
she possessed a strong sense of gratitude and a
sort of filial affection, but for the genuine article
she seemed to be incapable of its entertainment.</p>

<p>When Patty was eighteen the circus to which
she was attached arranged for a tour of the Australian
continent, and at San Francisco the “main
guy” engaged a lot of fresh talent, some of the
old-timers not relishing the salt water voyage.
Several of these new performers were adepts in
their particular lines, and one was especially so,
as Old Props had bitter cause to remember. The
circus showed all through New Zealand with remarkable
financial success and Patty won unbounded
honors from the colonials, and was, besides,
the life of the troupe. It was at this period—perhaps
the semi-tropical climate was partially
responsible for it—that Patty was the recipient of
numerous proposals for her hand, both from within
and without the circus. But each new suitor<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
was received in much the same manner. A merry
laugh spoiled all their sentimental speeches; they
were referred to the ringmaster; she excused herself
on the plea of practising a new jig-step for
the side-show, or with the utmost unconcern declined
the offer and went on feeding the monkeys
in the menagerie as if nothing unusual had happened
to disturb her tranquility. On one occasion
when Old Props was leading her horse around the
ring while the clown was working the risibilities
of the audience she received a most impassioned
proposal from one of the balloon holders who was
assisting her in her “act” and near whom the
horse was halted just as the clown reached the
climax of his joke. The offer came during the
yelling of the delighted colonials, the sharp snapping
of the ring-master’s whip and the eccentric
tumbling of the professional joker, but for all that
it was a fervid appeal. Yet her sole answer was a
derisive laugh as she spurred on her horse with a
“Hi! ya,” and the next minute she was jumping,
not into her suitor’s arms, but through the paper
balloon he held outstretched in his hand.</p>

<p>But Patty’s days of freedom were rapidly diminishing,
and before the troupe reached Melbourne
Old Props made a discovery that rendered
him very uneasy. At San Francisco the management
had engaged among others a handsome<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
dashing young Apollo of perhaps twenty-five,
who was a perfect prodigy in his way. He was
considered the cleverest leaper, the most skillful
rider, and the best all-round man in the troupe,
and to crown all, he possessed a college education,
having, it is said, been graduated at Harvard.
His specialty was riding four horses bareback,
and owing to his prowess and fine presence
he was soon styled the “Adonis of the arena.”</p>

<p>It was not until the circus had unloaded at
Auckland, N. Z., and had toured through the
middle island that Patty seemed cognizant of the
young fellow’s varied attractions, but before long
she began to manifest in many ways her approval
of his society, much to the dismay of her
guardian, who scented trouble from the outset.
The young Adonis of the ring was quick to discover
the interest he had awakened, and deliberately
applied himself to the task of winning
Patty’s affections. By a hundred delicate attentions
and insinuating ways, such as Patty, poor
child, had never known in her previous career, he
paved his way into her good graces and aroused
in her that feeling which lies latent in the soul of
every maiden, but which few would have supposed
Patty possessed.</p>

<p>It was to this heartless scamp that Patty unreservedly
lost her heart. To the warnings of Old<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
Props, who, better versed in human nature, penetrated
her lover’s evil designs, the girl returned
an indignant protest, and for a time there was a
coolness between the two that grieved the old
property man sorely. Those whom Patty had
snubbed now began to take a mean revenge by
sneeringly alluding to her love affair and hinting
that all was not as it should be. Their remarks
when made in the hearing of Old Props drove him
nearly frantic, and for several weeks he was so
ugly and crabbled that he was unbearable and
even the main guy was compelled to reprimand
him for his surliness. As the affair progressed
Patty gradually lost all interest in her former
amusements, and even her little pet monkey in
the menagerie was wholly neglected. Instead of
lingering before his cage to pet and caress him as
was her wont, she now hurried by to meet her
lover, utterly oblivious of the tiny outstretched
paw or head cunningly askew waiting for its accustomed
caress. Poor “Mimi,” like Old Props,
was forgotten.</p>

<p>That grizzled veteran knew too well how it would
end. As the weeks grew into months, and the
foreign tour was drawing to a close, Old Props,
who watched Patty closer than any mother would
her child, saw with poignant regret how changed
the girl had become. Seldom was heard the old,<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
mellow, ringing laugh that was wont to cheer his
seared and toughened heart, and the former
jaunty step and vivacious air had completely
vanished. Yet to her guardian, who ached to
receive her confidence, Patty never vouchsafed a
word.</p>

<p>It was at Wagga Wagga, in Australia, noted as
the residence of the once-famous Tichborne claimant,
that Patty was taken ill, caused by over-exertion
in the ring, and a doctor who was called
imperatively forbade her proceeding any further.
The circus was then on its way to Sydney from
Melbourne, overland, and as the vessel on which the
return journey was to be made was due to sail on a
certain day the management was compelled to
leave Patty behind to follow on later. With the
circus went the contemptible wretch who was the
cause of her undoing, and when Old Props, who
remained to take care of his darling, told poor
Patty of the fellow’s heartlessness, she gave a
great gulp and then hid her face on the old man’s
breast and cried as she had never cried before.
Her whole pitiful story was unfolded in that bitter,
heartbroken wail.</p>

<p>Patty was very ill for many weeks, during which
time Old Props was her sole and constant attendant.
But the girl never rallied, and when her
baby was born, long after the circus was back in<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
the States, she had barely strength left to turn
her head to gaze at the innocent mite. It was a
poor, weak, sick specimen, that lived for a few
days only, and then its light went quietly out with
scarcely a perceptible struggle. There were no
tears in Patty’s eyes when her dead baby was
lifted to her face by the kind sister to receive a
farewell kiss, but when Old Props returned from
the sad task of laying the little one away he was
alarmed at the ghastly change in Patty’s pinched,
wasted features, and realized that in a few days
at the farthest she would rejoin her babe.</p>

</div>

<p>Poor, ignorant little Patty! Surely her sin will
not be visited on her head in the great hereafter,
but rather on the one who deliberately led her to
ruin. She lies in the quiet little cemetery adjoining
the English church at Wagga Wagga, in the
same grave with her baby, a plain white stone
erected by her heartbroken guardian marking the
spot where she is at rest. As for Old Props, he
will never go out with the red wagon again.</p>

<p>The little boy was crying and his tears touched
the heart of the charitably inclined lady; he was
so small and seemed to be in such distress.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, little boy,” she said, soothingly.
“Dry your eyes and tell me what the trouble is.
Did some of the big boys hurt you?”</p>

<p>“No’m,” replied the waif, still sobbing.</p>

<p>“Are you sick or hungry?” she persisted.</p>

<p>“No’m.”</p>

<p>“Did your father beat you for something?”</p>

<p>“No’m, but he will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the trouble, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a shame,” she exclaimed, angrily.
“Why will he beat you?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I lost ten cents.”</p>

<p>“Did he send you to buy something with it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“And you lost it on the way?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I guess we can fix that,” she said in
her kindly way, as she took a dime from her purse
and handed it to the boy. “Now he won’t beat
you, will he?”</p>

<p>“No’m.”</p>

<p>“What did he send you to buy with it?”</p>

<p>“Beer.”</p>

<p>“Beer!” The good lady gasped at the thought.</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“And how did you lose it?”</p>

<p>“Matchin’ pennies.”</p>

<p>Before she had sufficiently recovered to demand

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
